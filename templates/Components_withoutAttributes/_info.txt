We use attributes to specify several situations in XML elements. Unfortunately, Scilab don't have any function to remove XML attributes (xmlRemove should be updated!); and therefore when they are added, they cannot be removed. That's the reason why this folder was created. The elements in the XML files don't have any attributes. The attributes are added only if necessary; otherwise, they are omitted. This is very important for our application!
