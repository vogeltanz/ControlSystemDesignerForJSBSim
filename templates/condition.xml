<!--The set of conditional test operators that can be used is as follows (The conditional operators can also be written in lower case):
	EQ or == (equal to)
	NE or != (not equal to)
	LT or <  (less than)
	LE or <= (less than or equal to)
	GT or >  (greater than)
	GE or >= (greater than or equal to)
	
	Note: The standard mathematical operators (i.e. "<=") can cause problems with some XML applications, since the angle brackets have special meaning. It is best to avoid their use.
